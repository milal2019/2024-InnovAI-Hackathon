In today's fast-paced business environment, companies and organizations rely heavily on document processing for tasks like accounting, financial management, and inventory tracking. One of the most common documents processed by businesses is the invoice, which contains critical information, such as vendor details, item descriptions, and financial amounts. However, manually extracting data from invoices is a time-consuming and error-prone task.

Currently, many businesses still rely on manual data entry, which increases operational costs, delays processing time, and introduces human errors. This problem becomes even more significant in industries where large volumes of invoices and receipts need to be processed daily. The challenge is not just about extracting data but also classifying documents and ensuring accurate processing.

Impact and Proposed Solution
The goal of this project is to create an efficient Invoice OCR and Document Processing System that automates the extraction and classification of data from invoices, bank statements, and other document types. Using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and AI classification models, the system can significantly reduce the time spent on manual document handling and improve the accuracy of data extraction.

Our solution aims to streamline business workflows by:

Automatically extracting key data (e.g., vendor names, invoice amounts, dates, etc.) from scanned invoices.
Classifying documents (e.g., identifying whether they are invoices, bank statements, or other document types).
Providing a user-friendly interface for clients and accountants to manage documents.
By automating this process, businesses will save time, reduce errors, and enhance productivity, ultimately leading to better decision-making and more efficient operations.
